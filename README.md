# 01-Introduction

This code prints the information requested by the assignment. This includes answering the six 
questions asked on canvas, but part of the grading criteria was to add interesting features, 
so I also added a section of code that asks the reader for input where I ask questions. It 
then pretends like it is sentient and wants a conversation with you.
